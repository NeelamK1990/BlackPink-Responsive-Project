            <h2>Why BlackPink</h2>
            <h3>Why BlackPink is so Popular?</h3>
            <p>
              The most significant part of BLACKPINK's popularity lies in the
              group's undeniable stage presence and their songs and bilingual
              lyrics, which talks about independence and vulnerability.
              BLACKPINK is also known for their video styling or "concepts" for
              each song.They are the first ever K-pop girl group to perform in
              Coachella.
            </p>
            <p>
              BLACKPINK has always been known as a girl group with many
              outstanding international achievements. Their international
              fanbase is also extremely strong, willing to spend money on
              idol-related products and contribute significantly to the group’s
              achievements. Specifically, recently, thanks to the love of fans,
              especially international fans, BLACKPINK has become a K-Pop girl
              group to become a million album seller with their first full-album
